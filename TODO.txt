# Scraping

[ ] ! come up with more generic way to run through the products
[ ] ! implement scraping with the query in queries based in the site


# Dashboard

[ ] ? "Run scraping" button
    - is protected and manually runs the scraping script and updates
    the dashboard
[ ] implement auto reload of the table when you update a query
    - will be tricky because the scraping will probably take a while
    might be better to just say "added, come back later for update"
[ ] toggle queries
    [ ] add new field to model
    [ ] only show the values for the queries that are toggled on



# Hosting

[ ] figure out hosting
    - might either do in house with no access or on a simple site and
    do an ip whitelist only for mine, dont need to complicate things
    for this

[x] implement query creation
[x] ? create new products from the dashboard
    - would be kinda cool, make the state be a couple files with a bool value
    and some enums for different sites that have resolvers and just need a
    query value
[x] style the table
[x] setup git
