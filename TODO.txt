[ ] implement scraping with the query in queries based in the site
[ ] implement auto reload of the table when you update a query
    - will be tricky because the scraping will probably take a while
    might be better to just say "added, come back later for update"



[ ] implement scraping for the different products

[ ] come up with more generic way to run through the products

[ ] turn off products
[ ] figure out hosting
[ ] setup git

[x] implement query creation
[x] ? create new products from the dashboard
    - would be kinda cool, make the state be a couple files with a bool value
    and some enums for different sites that have resolvers and just need a
    query value
[x] style the table
